Let's try this again.

This is the final project of the first semester of CSET

To work with the npm packages:
    1) Open your terminal in VS Code
    2) Make sure you have Node and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. If you don't, I'd recommend installing it with nvm, the Node Version Manager. Linode has a really good walkthrough on how to do this [here](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-use-node-version-manager-nvm/).
    3) Clear out your terminal, make sure you're still in the directory for this repository, and enter "npm install"
    4) All of the packages should then be installed. The package.json file saves the dependencies and the .gitignore file keeps the huge amount of files from getting sent to github.
